Video Script: 
TimeMaster: Learn and Play 
-	A game designed for users aged 10-12 who are in their final years of primary school and moving into high school. 
-	The game’s purpose is to provide insight into different scenarios they may experience going into high school.
-	Alongside teaching them best social practices related to time management – for example, ensuring they leave enough time to get to a location or appointment and won’t be late. 

-	When users first begin the game, they are given a run-down of how to navigate the game, including what prompts will progress the game. 

-	There is also a comment about other commitments the user has outside of school, and I chose to include this at the beginning rather than throughout the game, as it puts the responsibility on the user to remember this. Which is how it would be in real life. 

-	There are a range of different characters throughout the game, that provide the user with information and then pose a question on how the user wants to proceed. 

-	The questions that are asked, are framed to be closed questions to minimise confusion on the user end. 

-	If the user answers incorrectly, instead of having a harsh response saying they got it wrong, the relevant character will tell them what the best response would be and why. 

-	Providing users with the why for an option will allow them to reflect and understand why that is the best option for themselves and for whoever they are meeting. 

-	Users are able to replay the game and provide different answers should they wish, however there are only two programmed responses per character. 

-	The other aspect of this game is to give insight into different scenarios they may experience, such as wanting to join a new activity but having already committed to something else. 

-	Having played this game, ideally, it will also open up conversations between the targeted user and their guardian/parent or teacher about time management and how to best respond in different situations.
